# Bank Widgets

## Overview
This is a simple application that provides some basic banking widgets like mortgate rates and budgeting. 

## Purpose
This web application was designed in order for me to practice building a web application using php as a backend. 

## How to use
This is a very straightforward application. There are two "widgets" on here that allow you to do a simple calculation of your monthly payment for your desired mortgage. This by no means is an accurate calculation as it does not factor in mortgage insurance, home insurance, or other related fields. However in general this widget takes your principle mortgage amount, subtracts by the down payment, and then divides the total by your desired fixed rate.

For this widget the front end is making a call to the php back end in order to get the current mortgage rate which is also factored into the month to month cost of your potential home.

The second widget is a simple budgeting tool that allows you to create and input your current month to month expenses and then shows you how much you can put towards savings.
